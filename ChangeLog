v2.1.2
    * Fix XSS in $flavour (CVE-2008-2236). Thanks to Yoshinori Ohta of
      Business Architects Inc. for making us aware of this issue.

v2.1.1
    * The "never trust a dot zero release" bugfix release for 2.1.0.
    * Added CVS Id keyword to file header.
    * Declaring $encode_xml_entities as a config option by moving it into
      the config section -- no functionality change.
    * Changing isPermalink back to "false" for the default RSS story
      template because it won't be a working link in many situations.
      This won't change the GUID, but don't let it be used as 
      anymore. That's what the <link> tag is for anyway. Thanks to Lilo
      von Hanffstengel for pointing this out.
    * Rewrote the (at least with Apache 2.2's environment) no more working
      manual base URL detection code. Made it simpler, easier to
      understand and let it only apply, if the base URL was not set
      manually. The concept since 2.0.2 was: Always ask for the whole URI
      and then remove the PATH_INFO in some cases again. This caused some
      havoc. New concept is: Strip PATH_INFO from base URL if CGI.pm
      didn't manage to do it. In those rare cases where neither CGI.pm nor
      Blosxom manages to correctly determine the base URL, you can easily
      set $url in the config file to the correct value and no base URL
      magic happens anymore (except the removing of a trailing slash if
      present -- as before). Closes: #2032685
    * Added a lot of comments explaining the fixed problems and the
      remaining seldom cases where manual configuration is necessary.

v2.1.0
    * unescape url returned from CGI.pm to match PATH_INFO escaping
    * redo path_info handling with much stricter date tests
    * added support for multiple plugin directories using $plugin_path
        * changed plugin loading to use @INC instead of hardcoded 
          $plugin_dir
        * added support for external config file via BLOSXOM_CONFIG_DIR 
          and/or BLOSXOM_CONFIG_FILE environment variables
        * added support for $plugin_list plugin config file
    * fixed several RSS and XHTML escaping issues (Closes: #1717980)
    * made the default templates conforming to HTML 4.01
      (Closes: #1609595)
    * added a testsuite for blosxom
    * added an encoding setting, defaulting to UTF-8
    * added support for configuration files and therefore blosxom farms
      (based on the Debian config file patch)
    * allowed the content of the content type template to be used as
      variable in other templates, e.g. for usage with <meta> tags.
    * many small improvements
    * some code refactoring (including a .perltidyrc)

v2.0.2
    * fixed path_info to have correct extension in static mode (bug
      1368882)
    * fixed filtering bug in static mode (bug 1356997)
    * changed DATA section template parsing to allow newlines for
      greater readability, and to allow empty templates.
    * work-around for bug in CGI::url() when using SSI

v2.0.1
    * Fixed XML escaping of RSS feeds
    * Ignore editor backup files in the plugin directory (i.e.
      "myplugin~")
